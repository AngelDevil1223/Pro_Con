producer.c:
    it takes the name of the input as a CLI argument, then opens the file
    iterating over each character and adding odd bit parity to it,
    and writes it to temporary
    then frame adds control character and split it into multiple
    chunck of data of lenght 64 bits.
    transmission error are simulated by makeError() function.

consumer.c:
    opens the outfile that is created by the producer as a CLI argument 
    and the out file then iterate over it first it gets the first 3 
    control character then read the data. Then checks for errors,
    and report the error to the user and exit

Data Flow :
    producer.c:
        character from input file -> goes to parity maker parity maker 
        -> from there it is written to a temporary file -> simulate error
        -> write data as chunks of 3 control character and 64 char into outfile

    consumer.c:
        open the output file from produer.c -> parity removal -> 
        check for error -> write into output file
